# ContaAzul API Examples
Simple examples that demonstrate:
1) how to use OAuth 2.0 to authorize an application to access user's resources;
2) how to execute CRUD operations on some of the resources exposed by the ContaAzul API.

Each language-specific directory contains the samples along with instructions to run them.

Further documentation of the API can be found at https://developers.contaazul.com.
